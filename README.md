# Movies-ETL

## Overview
Used the data pipeline process, extract, transform, and load, to convert raw data into a clean movie database in SQL. Data was extracted from two different sources using Python: a scrape of Wikipedia for all movies released since 1990 and rating data from the MovieLens website. This data was then transformed and cleaned using Pandas, and regular expressions were used to parse data and transform text into numbers. Finally, the data was loaded into a Postgres SQL table.
